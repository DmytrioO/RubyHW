Hello there! How you now, i have a file with game about your own pet. You can find it on
my Git-repository in /HW2/Game as a Game.rb:
[Game](https://github.com/DmytrioO/RubyHW/tree/main/HW2/Game)
This game created to make an html-file with statistics about your pet. Here we have module
Make\_HTML, that you can include in your project, and three functions:
1. get\_info - this function gets information about pet(breed, name, health, hunger, —Åheerfulness, 
mood and time), to use in the future functions.
2. put\_into\_html - this function gets information fron get\_info, and puts it into the 
html-file.
3. make\_css

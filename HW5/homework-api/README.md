# README about my rails api

Hello there! It's my first RoR api. It's created for learn
rails. Here you can make, view, change, or delete articles.
To use the API you need to run command "bundle install"
in directory with program from you command line. Than
you can write rails s, and open this link 
http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/articles
